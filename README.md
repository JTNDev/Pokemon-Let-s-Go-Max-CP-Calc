Hello! This is an app that lets you see the Max CP a Pokemon can have in the games Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee!
Only Pokedex Numbers 1 - 25, 150, 151, 808, and 809 are available (I'm adding more soon!).
You're able to pick the level range of the Pokemon and the nature the Pokemon can have!

Right now, it's exclusive to Mac but Windows (Forms/UWP), iOS, Android, and Linux support are planned.

We also want to release on the Google Play Store but I don't want to get sued as I'm using Pokemon's trademarks 
(the Pokemon names) but if someone is interested in bringing it onto the Google Play Store or the 
Apple App Store I will not stop you.

Some future features I want to add are a traditional IV calculator and an EV calculator.
To build just go into the Mac folder click on Xcode 10 and build inside of Xcode.
